This is a contact book application built using Java.
This project is based on the concept of Object Oriented Programming in Java.


Using this application , a user can own his/her own virtual contact book , where new contacts can be added or removed as well.
Basically the user has full access to the contact book.


The app requests the user to first select if they want to add or remove a contact. 
Then it requests the user to enter the name , phone number (10 digit number) , date of birth of the user whose contact is to be added.
Based on the date birth entered by the user , the age is calculated, make sure to ensure the date of birth in the prescribed format.
An example format has already been entered in the console. Users have to enter the details in the same specified format. 
A text document (names.txt) has also been added where the user can type in the contact details of the person ( as per format already present in the text document).
Once the details are added in the text file, the details are automatically added to the console in the required format. 


Hence , the user can update new details in the console itself , following the steps or directly add a new contact to the text document.
Once the console is reloaded again , all the contacts will be saved and reloaded as per previously made changes.


To run the appication , you will need to run the main4.java file after loading all the other included files as well.
Hope this application is of good help .
